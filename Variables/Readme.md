## Learning about Variables in Terraform

I learned that :
* Variables are place holders for inputs 
* Can be used to hide secret credentials(Which I have used in this Terraform learning modules to store my AWS credentials)

I have defined AWS as Provider, defined variables for:  
1. AWS Access key
2. AwS Secret key
3. AMI
