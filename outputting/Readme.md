## Outputting in action ##

This is in furtherance of Learning how Terraform works.

Here, I learned that Output is used to extract the value of an output variable.
 
 In this module, I got "Ip address" as the output of the AWS instance defined in the resource script.
 
Instead of going to AWS interface to get the IP address of the server , it is displayed as the output.
